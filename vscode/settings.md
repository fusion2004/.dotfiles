# VSCode Settings

Install the [settings sync extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)

It should automatically ask you to login to GitHub and choose the existing settings gist. For reference, [this is the gist](https://gist.github.com/fusion2004/71c79106c66a76c6121257b97e8e05c3).

Make sure to configure it to automatically upload and download!
